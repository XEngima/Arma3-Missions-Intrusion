			"Each player has a rank, and each player's starting rank is 'Private'. The more the player's group performs, the more rating is generated to its members, and at certains levels the players 'rank' is increased. The ranks are Private, Corpral, Seargent, Leutenant, Captain, Major and Colonel. Note that rating is shared equally among the members of the group, so the ability that increases the rating morstly is cooperation. The possibility for the leader to select a profession is sometimes limited by his or her rank.<br /><br />" +

			" - The group loses its squad vehicle<br />" +

			"All hand held weapons show up in ammo boxes in the base. In the beginning, the only weapons that exist are basic weapons. The longer the mission progresses - and the more technology that is collected from offices - the more advanced weapons will show up later in the game.<br /><br />" +
			"Note that some of the weapons are associated with certain professions, and cannot be used by everyone.<br /><br />" +
			"WEAPONS IN VEHICLES<br /><br />" +

			player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["Professions",
			"A squad assigned to a profession will get the vehicles and weapons that are associated with the profession. However, weapons and vehicles will not be delivered from start, but when the side has earned enough of both kinds of resources. A few requirements must be met before a group leader can select a profession. Such requirements are among max. and min. number of players in the group, limited number of groups on a side, and required rank of the players. All information is listed in the profession dialog.<br /><br />" +
			"While no profession is selected, the squad will be of profession type Infantry. Infantry only has the ammo box weapons and the basic 'free vehicles' that anyone can use.<br /><br />"+
			"HOW TO SELECT A PROFESSION<br />" +
			"1. Only the squad leader can select a profession for the squad.<br />" +
			"2. From the Intrusion menu, select 'Set group profession'.<br />" +
			"3. On the profession dialog, select a profession that is not greyed out and press 'Select'."]];

			player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["Squads",
			"All players are divided into squads. From start each inidividual player is the leader of his or her own squad. Creating squads enable some of the professions and makes it easier to increase player's rank.<br /><br />"+
			"HOW TO GROUP UP WITH ANOTHER PLAYER<br />" +
			"1. Move next to another player. The player need to be alone in his or her group.<br />" +
			"2. Turn to the player and from the action menu select 'Invite player to group'."]];

			player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["Resources",
			"For each side to get more advanced vehicles and weapons they will need to bring in resources by securing the resource locations marked on the map. The resources are of two types, production and technology. The brigade's current resource income can be seen in the top left corner of the screen.<br /><br />" +
			"FACTORIES AND PRODUCTION<br /><br />" +
			"Factories generate production. Production is needed for the brigade to produce vehicles. It can be thought of as money for which vehicles can be 'bought'.<br /><br />" +
			"When a squad assigns to a profession that has a vehicle, a vehicle order/reservation is placed in a queue at the side's production manager. The first vehicle in the queue is delivered when the vehicle's required technology is established and when the side has enough production to create it. Then the next order in the queue is handled. When a vehicle is delivered, its cost is withdrawn from the side's total production. And the production cost of a vehicle that is removed by the framework (e.g. its owner logged out) will be returned to the side upon removal.<br /><br />" +
			"OFFICES AND TECHNOLOGY<br /><br />" +
			"Offices generate technology, and technology leads to 'establishments' of new and upgraded units. Technology is the resource needed for the brigade to establish more and more advanced vehicles and materiel. In opposite to production it is not withdrawn when technologies are established, but each technology is unlocked at a certain level of technology."]];

			player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["The Intrusion Menu",
			"All special Intrusion actions that can be taken is put into the Intrusion Menu, which is a context based action menu that can be reached from anyone and anywhere. The Intrusion menu is context based, which means that only maningful actions are shown. E.g. only a group leader has an option for selecting a profession for its squad, and only the brigade leader has an option for moving the base."]];
			
			player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["Philosophy",
			"The main philosophy behind Intrusion is to encourage a gameplay style that simulates the use of weapons and vehicles in the way they are used in real life, and at the same time offers a fun gameplay relatively easy to embrace. You should be able to play and do good if ju just join an Intrusion server for the first time, and at the same time your side should be uncontested if you and all your side members develop good communication and everyone stick to their roles. Like in real life, the use of teams, roles, communications and leadership strategies on different levels are essential to form a winning army. What a single unit does is of importance, but not compared to what the side can accomplish when its members are supporting each other in all kinds of situations. Like in a real battle there are a limited amount of resources available, but even an outcounted group of people may beat a superior enemy if fighting well together."]];

			player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["Overview",
			"An intrusion battle is limited in time and played like a match between two sides - blufor and opfor. A game of Intrusion has a clear progression, which means that both sides starts out with basic weapons and primitive vehicles. Then the longer the game progresses the more advanced vehicles and wepons will come into play.<br /><br />" +
			"The map contains resource locations, and the more resources that a side can bring in, the quicker its squads with different specializations (professions) will be equipped with stronger weapons and vehicles that increase the side's chances of winning the battle.<br /><br />" +
			"One of the resource locations are randomly selected as the winner's location. The side holding the winner's location when the time is up will be the winning side of the battle."]];

			"Players can arrange their groups by themselves. A player who invites another player to his/her group becomes the group leader. To invite another alone player, move near him and use action command Invite.<br /><br />" + 
			"GROUP PROFESSION<br /><br />" +
			"When a group is created the group leader can choose a profession for the group. This is done using radio command 0-0-5 and then the action menu.<br /><br />" + 
			"Group profession is of importance for vehicles and equipment assigned to the group. Available professions depend on group size and on how many groups of a given profession that is allowed for each side in the mission.<br /><br />" + 
			"STRATEGIC LOCATIONS<br /><br />" +
			"Strategic locations are marked on the map. The side that owns a strategic location recieves an income of its resources. Resources can be of two kinds: Technology or Production. All resources is accumulated during the time that the current side is in control of that location. A blue marker means that the location is controlled by NATO. A red that the location is controlled by CSAT. A green marker is neutral, i.e. not yet taken by any side.<br /><br />" +
			"RESOURCES ASSIGNMENT<br /><br />" +
			"The resource Technology provides your brigade with knowledge of more advanced equipment. Technology is used by the brigade commander to develop (unlock) different technologies. Every technology (e.g. Tanks) has a cost in technology points, and the more technology points aquired, the faster it gets access to more advanced vehicles and equipment.<br /><br />" +
			"The resource Production is needed to produce vehicles and equipment. Once a technology (e.g. Tanks) is obtained, Production is needed to create the vehicles. Every tank has a cost in Production points, and the more Production points aquired, the more vehicles can be created for the brigade.<br /><br />" +
			"VEHICLES ASSIGNMENT<br /><br />" +
			"To create vehicles the brigade needs Production. Production points is not rewarded any individual group, but the brigade as a whole. All groups that need vehicles are therefore put in a queue. One by one they are assigned vehicles, in a rate according to the overall Production income. Vehicle type and how many vehicles assigned to the group depends on group size. A small group will only need one vehicle, while a group with many members may need more vehicles. It is more expensive and it takes longer to get several vehicles. Cost is usually also increased for more advanced vehicles. Support vehicles (like Fuel or Repair) is given priority.<br /><br />" +
			"If all vehicles for a group is destroyed then the group will serve as an ordinary infantry group again, until the brigade can afford assigning the group new vehicles. Accordingly, take good care of your vehicles!<br /><br />" +
			"HOW TO PLAY AS BRIGADE COMMANDER<br /><br />" +
			"The brigade commander's task is to coordinate all fighting units. Brigade commander can order groups to attack, defend, regroup or recon different areas. This is done in the following way:<br />" +
			"  1. Click close to a group on the map. The group closes to the click point is selected.<br />" +
			"  2. Select an order using radio commands 0-0-1 to 0-0-4.<br />" +
			"  3. Select a destination by clicking again on the map. The group is now given the order and recieves an in game task.<br />"]];
