			"Players can arrange their groups by themselves. A player who invites another player to his/her group becomes the group leader. To invite another alone player, move near him and use action command Invite.<br /><br />" + 
			"GROUP PROFESSION<br /><br />" +
			"When a group is created the group leader can choose a profession for the group. This is done using radio command 0-0-5 and then the action menu.<br /><br />" + 
			"Group profession is of importance for vehicles and equipment assigned to the group. Available professions depend on group size and on how many groups of a given profession that is allowed for each side in the mission.<br /><br />" + 
			"STRATEGIC LOCATIONS<br /><br />" +
			"Strategic locations are marked on the map. The side that owns a strategic location recieves an income of its resources. Resources can be of two kinds: Technology or Production. All resources is accumulated during the time that the current side is in control of that location. A blue marker means that the location is controlled by NATO. A red that the location is controlled by CSAT. A green marker is neutral, i.e. not yet taken by any side.<br /><br />" +
			"RESOURCES ASSIGNMENT<br /><br />" +
			"The resource Technology provides your brigade with knowledge of more advanced equipment. Technology is used by the brigade commander to develop (unlock) different technologies. Every technology (e.g. Tanks) has a cost in technology points, and the more technology points aquired, the faster it gets access to more advanced vehicles and equipment.<br /><br />" +
			"The resource Production is needed to produce vehicles and equipment. Once a technology (e.g. Tanks) is obtained, Production is needed to create the vehicles. Every tank has a cost in Production points, and the more Production points aquired, the more vehicles can be created for the brigade.<br /><br />" +
			"VEHICLES ASSIGNMENT<br /><br />" +
			"To create vehicles the brigade needs Production. Production points is not rewarded any individual group, but the brigade as a whole. All groups that need vehicles are therefore put in a queue. One by one they are assigned vehicles, in a rate according to the overall Production income. Vehicle type and how many vehicles assigned to the group depends on group size. A small group will only need one vehicle, while a group with many members may need more vehicles. It is more expensive and it takes longer to get several vehicles. Cost is usually also increased for more advanced vehicles. Support vehicles (like Fuel or Repair) is given priority.<br /><br />" +
			"If all vehicles for a group is destroyed then the group will serve as an ordinary infantry group again, until the brigade can afford assigning the group new vehicles. Accordingly, take good care of your vehicles!<br /><br />" +
			"HOW TO PLAY AS BRIGADE COMMANDER<br /><br />" +
			"The brigade commander's task is to coordinate all fighting units. Brigade commander can order groups to attack, defend, regroup or recon different areas. This is done in the following way:<br />" +
			"  1. Click close to a group on the map. The group closes to the click point is selected.<br />" +
			"  2. Select an order using radio commands 0-0-1 to 0-0-4.<br />" +
			"  3. Select a destination by clicking again on the map. The group is now given the order and recieves an in game task.<br />"]];
