			"RANK AND RATING<br /><br />" +
			"Each player has a rank, and each player's starting rank is 'Private'. The more the player's group performs, the more rating is generated to its members, and at certains levels the players 'rank' is increased. The ranks are Private, Corpral, Seargent, Leutenant, Captain, Major and Colonel. Note that rating is shared equally among the members of the group, so the ability that increases the rating morstly is cooperation. The possibility for the leader to select a profession is sometimes limited by his or her rank.<br /><br />" +
			"SQUAD BONUS<br /><br />" +
			"The more members a squad has, the more rating is generated for its deeds.<br /><br />" +
			"RATING IS SOMETIMES BLOCKED<br /><br />" +

			" - Group members are to far apart<br />" +
			" - A group member respawns<br />" +
			" - The group loses its squad vehicle<br />" +
			" - A group member team kills<br />"]];

			player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["Weapons",
			"HANDHELD WEAPONS<br /><br />" +
			"All hand held weapons show up in ammo boxes in the base. In the beginning, the only weapons that exist are basic weapons. The longer the mission progresses - and the more technology that is collected from offices (see Resources) - the more advanced weapons will become available.<br /><br />" +
			"Note that some of the weapons are associated with certain professions, and therefore cannot be used by everyone.<br /><br />" +
			"WEAPONS IN VEHICLES<br /><br />" +
			"The heavy weapons (static weapons like mortars and anti armor) that belong to some of the professions are loaded into the squad vehicles' cargo space. A profession vehicle's cargo space can be opened by the squad that owns it."]];

			player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["Professions",
			"WHAT IS A PROFESSION?<br /><br />" +
			"A profession is a military role for the squad, such as Transport, Infantry, Artillery or Attack Helicopter among others. A squad assigned to a profession will get the vehicles and weapons that are associated with that profession. However, weapons and vehicles will not be delivered from start.<br /><br />" +
			"ALL SQUADS START OUT AS INFANTRY<br /><br />" +
			"While no profession is selected, the squad will be of profession type Infantry. Infantry only has the ammo box weapons and the basic 'free vehicles' that anyone can use. All squads - even the ones selecting a profession from start - start out as infantry. Some professions require a certain rank for the squad leader to be able to select it (see Rank And Rating). Later when the side has earned enough technology to establish the squad's materiel and enough resources to deliver it, the materiel will be delivered to the base. The squad can then 'respawn to base' using the Intrusion Menu, and start acting as its selected profession.<br /><br />"+
			"HOW TO SELECT A PROFESSION<br /><br />" +
			"1. Only the squad leader can select a profession for the squad.<br />" +
			"2. From the Intrusion menu, select 'Set group profession'.<br />" +
			"3. On the profession dialog, select a profession that is not greyed out and press 'Select'."]];

			player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["Squads",
			"All players belong to a squad. From start each inidividual player is the leader of his or her own one man squad. As a one man squad you are fine to play, but only a few of the professions will be available. You can invite other one man squad players into your squad to bild a greater team. Then other professions will be available to your squad, and the greater squad the more rating (and rank) your squad members will be rewarded for the squad's deeds.<br /><br />"+
			"HOW TO GROUP UP WITH ANOTHER PLAYER<br /><br />" +
			"1. Move next to another player. That player needs to be alone in his or her group.<br />" +
			"2. Turn to the player, and from the action menu select 'Invite player to group'."]];

			player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["Resources",
			"Like in real life, winning a war is about securing necessary kinds of resources. For each side to get more advanced vehicles and weapons they will need to bring in resources. They do that by securing resource locations marked on the map. The resources are of two kinds: production and technology. The brigade's current resource income can be seen in the top left corner of the screen.<br /><br />" +
			"FACTORIES AND PRODUCTION<br /><br />" +
			"Factories generate production. Production is needed for the brigade to produce vehicles. It can be thought of as money for which vehicles can be 'bought'. Or even better: facilities that speed up the manufacturing of new material.<br /><br />" +
			"When a squad assigns to a profession that has a vehicle, a vehicle order/reservation is placed in a queue at the side's production manager. The first vehicle in the queue is delivered when the vehicle's required technology is established and when the side has enough production to create it. Then the next order in the queue is handled. When a vehicle is delivered, its cost is withdrawn from the side's total production. And the production cost of a vehicle that is removed by the framework (e.g. its owner logged out) will be returned to the side upon removal.<br /><br />" +
			"OFFICES AND TECHNOLOGY<br /><br />" +
			"Offices generate technology, and technology leads to 'establishments' of new and upgraded units. Technology is the resource needed for the brigade to establish more advanced vehicles and materiel. In opposite to production it is not withdrawn when technologies are established, but each technology is unlocked at a certain level of technology."]];

			player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["Philosophy",
			"The main philosophy behind Intrusion is to encourage a gameplay style where players make use of weapons and vehicles in the way they are used in real life, and at the same time offers a fun gameplay relatively easy to embrace.<br /><br />" +
			"You should be able to play and do good if you join an Intrusion server for the first time, and at the same time your side should be uncontested if you and all your side members develop good communication and everyone stick to their roles. Like in real life, the use of teams, roles, communications and leadership strategies on different levels are essential for victory. What a single unit does is of importance, but not compared to what the side can accomplish when its members are supporting each other in all kinds of evolving situations. Like in a real battle available resources are limited, but even an outcounted group of people may beat a superior enemy if fighting well together and acting unexpectingly."]];

			"The more resource locations your side owns, the more income your side will have.<br /><br />" +
			"The more income your side has, the more vehicles and weapons will spawn and become available.<br /><br />" +
			"Income is of two types - production (comes from factories) and administration (comes from offices).<br /><br />" +
			"The more income of production your side has, the more war materiel your side can aquire (i.e. more vehicles).<br /><br />" +
			"The more income of administration your side has, the more advanced your side's materiel can be (i.e. stronger vehicles).<br /><br />" +
			"Your side's income will be shared among all the squads (groups) of your side, and squads will get vehicles depending on their position in the side's production queue (so you might have to wait).<br /><br />" +
			"A brigade leader on each side commands the squads, giving different kinds of orders to be carried out, fulfilling the purpose of the brigade's strategic warfare.<br /><br />" +
			"The side that owns the resource location marked with a flag when the time is up wins the battle.<br /><br />" +
			"All players have a rating that increases when performing good deeds (like killing enemies, capturing flags, and fulfilling brigade leader orders). Players get rating bonuses the more players there are in their squad.<br /><br />" +
			"All players belong to a squad (even though there is only one player in it), and each squad selects a profession that determines what kind of vehicle and weapons they are allowed to control. You cannot select between all professions. Which ones that are available depends on the current squad leader's rating, squad size, and how many of a profession that the brigade already occupies."]];

			"Players can arrange their groups by themselves. A player who invites another player to his/her group becomes the group leader. To invite another alone player, move near him and use action command Invite.<br /><br />" + 
			"GROUP PROFESSION<br /><br />" +
			"When a group is created the group leader can choose a profession for the group. This is done using radio command 0-0-5 and then the action menu.<br /><br />" + 
			"Group profession is of importance for vehicles and equipment assigned to the group. Available professions depend on group size and on how many groups of a given profession that is allowed for each side in the mission.<br /><br />" + 
			"STRATEGIC LOCATIONS<br /><br />" +
			"Strategic locations are marked on the map. The side that owns a strategic location recieves an income of its resources. Resources can be of two kinds: Technology or Production. All resources is accumulated during the time that the current side is in control of that location. A blue marker means that the location is controlled by NATO. A red that the location is controlled by CSAT. A green marker is neutral, i.e. not yet taken by any side.<br /><br />" +
			"RESOURCES ASSIGNMENT<br /><br />" +
			"The resource Technology provides your brigade with knowledge of more advanced equipment. Technology is used by the brigade commander to develop (unlock) different technologies. Every technology (e.g. Tanks) has a cost in technology points, and the more technology points aquired, the faster it gets access to more advanced vehicles and equipment.<br /><br />" +
			"The resource Production is needed to produce vehicles and equipment. Once a technology (e.g. Tanks) is obtained, Production is needed to create the vehicles. Every tank has a cost in Production points, and the more Production points aquired, the more vehicles can be created for the brigade.<br /><br />" +
			"VEHICLES ASSIGNMENT<br /><br />" +
			"To create vehicles the brigade needs Production. Production points is not rewarded any individual group, but the brigade as a whole. All groups that need vehicles are therefore put in a queue. One by one they are assigned vehicles, in a rate according to the overall Production income. Vehicle type and how many vehicles assigned to the group depends on group size. A small group will only need one vehicle, while a group with many members may need more vehicles. It is more expensive and it takes longer to get several vehicles. Cost is usually also increased for more advanced vehicles. Support vehicles (like Fuel or Repair) is given priority.<br /><br />" +
			"If all vehicles for a group is destroyed then the group will serve as an ordinary infantry group again, until the brigade can afford assigning the group new vehicles. Accordingly, take good care of your vehicles!<br /><br />" +
			"HOW TO PLAY AS BRIGADE COMMANDER<br /><br />" +
			"The brigade commander's task is to coordinate all fighting units. Brigade commander can order groups to attack, defend, regroup or recon different areas. This is done in the following way:<br />" +
			"  1. Click close to a group on the map. The group closes to the click point is selected.<br />" +
			"  2. Select an order using radio commands 0-0-1 to 0-0-4.<br />" +
			"  3. Select a destination by clicking again on the map. The group is now given the order and recieves an in game task.<br />"]];
