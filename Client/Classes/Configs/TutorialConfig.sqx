We need to capture and hold as many of the resource locations as possible. That will give us resources needed to develop a stronger force. If we hold location when the time is up we will have victory!\n\nABOUT THIS GAME MODE\nIntrusion is a game mode for anyone who wants to play for fun, but at the same time utilize the organized and tactical part of Arma 3. Join alone or with your friends and fight as a specialized group with personally assigned vehicles and equipment. A brigade leader (player) will command you and the other groups for a common purpose.\n\nWELCOME ALONE OR IN A GROUP!\nAs you will see, much of the contents in this game mode requires you to group up with other people. However, here is also plenty of room for single players.\n\nPICK A PROFESSION\nAs a first step, group up with your team mates if there are any. To do that, move near them and invite them to your group using the action menu [mouse wheel].\n\nThen pick a profession. You select a profession with the action menu [mouse wheel]. Which professions that are available depend on the size of your group and other group's professions. You (or the leader of your group) can change profession at any time (by selecting the radio command ""Toggle Group professions"" [0-0-5]).\n\nGUIDES\nGuides like this one will appear for new events until you press ""Turn off all guides"".\n\nNow, capture the flags, and have fun!"

The more areas your side posesses, the more and more advanced vehicles will be available for your side. There are two different kinds of strategic locations (flags) - factories and tech labs. You can see an overview of your side's income and groups if you select radio command 0-0-6 (Show brigade info).\n\nPRODUCTION\nFor each factory owned by your side, income in production is increased. Production is used to produce vehicles. The more production, the more vehicles can be produced.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\nFor each tech lab that your side owns, income in technology is increased. Technology is used to develop more advanced weapons and vehicles. The more technology, the faster the development of new materiel will be.\n\nTo see an overview of available and obtained technologies, select radio command 0-0-7 (Show tech tree).\n\nYOUR BRIGADE LEADER HAS THE BIG PICTURE\nThe brigade leader of your side has the big picture of what kind of strategic locations your side needs. His/Her orders show up as tasks. Follow them to achieve the best results for your side."
